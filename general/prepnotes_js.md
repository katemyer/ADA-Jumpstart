00 Social Justice
Introduction to social justice
Start by reviewing our glossary of social justice terms.
Institutional racism: places giving biased treatment to a group of people based on race (usc-ish)
Implicit bias: decisions in an unconscious manner
Microaggression: slight snubs based on marginalized membership
Microresistance: observe, think, feel, desire what happens to combat microaggressions

Then read and reflect on these articles
#FFFFFF Diversity by Erica Joy
Black woman in tech (Google). Their version of diversity was just “women” and the majority of them are white. White privilege, lacking in “women” of “color” in tech = white feminism in tech.
Aside from black and brown, there are asians who make up 30% of tech and they are the “model minority”
What Being Non-Binary in Female-Centric Spaces Is Like – And How to Be More Inclusive by Sam Escobar
Ask people what they prefer to be referred to as before assuming it’s ok to call them ma'am or email everyone as hi ladies. Use: Hi FOLKS.
Nonbinary: does not refer to themselves as female nor male, they are fluid in sexuality
Allies and Microaggressions by Kerry Ann Rockquemore
Article about ceo’s meeting to tour a hockey stadium and someone making a comment (microaggression) that females would rather be shopping at this time
Learn how to speak up with microresistence: observe the aggression, feel it, then think about what you want to happen once you speak up
Reflection
We suggest that you do some personal journaling, or explore these topics in conversation with a close friend or family member. Your responses to the following questions or to the articles themselves may be personal, and we don't ask that you share you thoughts with us. However, if you would like to be in conversation with us or have any follow-up questions, you can reach out to Sarah via email or slack.
Reflection questions
We are including a few reflection questions which you can use as a guide if you are having trouble getting started. You can address all of our prompts, choose only a few, or come up with your own.
What, if anything, was new to you here? What additional questions does this raise for you?
Being hyper aware and sensitive to gender identification and how to refer to people. 
After reading Joy's article, what is one way you would like to see tech companies or organizations champion diversity and inclusion beyond "women"?
Don’t even use pronouns, refer to people by their names. 
Teach diversity right off the bat without focusing so much on women vs men, talk about culture, experiences that create someone’s life and how that contributes to the growth of technology.
Important to really put some psychology into this. Learning to read people’s intentions before jumping the gun on everything and anything. Teaching people to be sensitive but also not being hyper sensitive yourself. This leans into victim mentality. 
Microaggressions are not explicitly defined in Rockquemore's article. Based on the context or on previous experience, how would you explain what a microaggression is in your own words? What are some examples of ways you can practice "micro resistance" in your own life?
Making assumptions on someone based on their appearance then verbalizing. “Do you speak English? Are you ghetto?” Or statements that try to be funny at the expense at someone else’s existence.
Teach the future how not to be the way we are. Teaching being aware and present, think before you speak.

01 Learning Styles
VARK (Neil Fleming)
Visual: graphs, charts, symbols replaced with important words, color coordination (bullet journal)
Auditory: hearing lectures, speaking out loud concepts, explain notes
Reading/Writing: lists, words, diaries, organize ideas into statements, note takers
Kinesthetic: learn by doing/experiencing, use pictures to illustrate ideas

How Successful People Stay Calm, on Forbes
Dr. Travis Bradberry (Emotional Intelligence 2.0)
90% of top performers skilled @ managing their emotions in times of stress 
well-honed coping strategies lowers stress levels regardless of environment, ensuring stress is intermittent and not prolonged.
performance peaks under the heightened activation that comes with moderate levels of stress
Elizabeth Kirby (Cal), found that the onset of stress entices the brain into growing new cells responsible for improved memory
Coping Strategies
Being appreciative reduces cortisol by 23% (UC Davis)
Avoid “what ifs”
Staying positive and having something positive to think about helps shift brain to this when things are going bad
Disconnect from being accessible, they go offline
Limit Caffeine bc increases adrenaline which makes emotions overrun behavior
Get Sleep
No negative self talk- write down their negative thoughts/feelings right away to get rid of them
Change perspectives: A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list the specific things that actually are going wrong or not working out.
Breathe
Use Support system, ask for help

02 Program Solving

Algorithms:
Input: initial state with input values
Output: results using input values
Finiteness: start and stop, includes time limits
Definiteness: precise and unambiguous # of iterations
Effectiveness: sufficiently simple

Optional reading: What’s a good test case?
Ability to test and retest but shows improvement for developers by finding bugs, helps companies max shipments, establishes low risks for lawsuits and errors, finds defects.
Results from test cases should be powerful, yield significant findings thus more credible, representative and informative

Watch the Driverless Car Hits the Street - Not People (2008) and think about why writing instructions for computers might be different than writing instructions for humans.
Autonomous driving for computers lacks emotion which affects human driving. We don’t have to take into account mood, sleep, stress, life events that distract from driving. In computers, it can be more straightfoward. Inputs and outputs are more black and white. 
Robots don’t think like humans nor do they function like humans. Everything has to be programmed. 
Then watch The 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals (2015), a more recent video and think about what the computer scientists writing code for these robots have to think about. What inputs do they have? What is their intended output? How are their algorithms considered Definite, Effective, and Finite?
Input: dirt road, valve, doors, use a drill, stairs
Output: turn value, open door, 
Algorithm: don’t fall over, keep balance.
Finite: time limits to do the tasks




Case 1: Make a PBJ Sandwich

Input: 
If Bread/Peanut Butter/Jelly/butter knife/spoon/plate=0
Output:
Then Quit.

Input:
2 slices of bread
Jar of peanut butter
Butter knife
Jar of jelly
Small spoon
Plate
Cutting Board

Finiteness: 5 minutes

Steps:
Place 2 slices of bread on cutting board side by side
Open peanut butter jar by twisting right
Insert butter knife to insert into peanut butter jar scooping out 2 tablespoons of peanut butter
Apply butter knife to left slice of bread starting at the upper left corner and spreading evenly across 90% of surface by moving top to bottom
If insufficient peanut butter, repeat steps 3-4
Open jelly jar by twisting right
Dip small spoon into jelly scooping out 1 tablespoon of jelly
Place spoon jelly side down on right slice of bread
Rotate spoon flat side to spread jelly starting at the upper left corner and spreading evenly across 90% of surface by moving top to bottom
If ratio of jelly to peanut butter is insufficient to achieve 1:2 ratio, repeat steps 7-8
Place right slice of bread with jelly onto left slice of bread with peanut butter by pressing firmly together
Repeat steps 1-11 for more peanut butter and jelly sandwiches





PREPARING TO CODE

03 Effective Internet Searching
Learning how to find the answers vs knowing the answers. Independent learning.
How to become a programmer, or the art of Googling well
Tenacity of googling until you find the right answer
Digging in research until it clicks, just have to be persistent versus a god 
How Search Works
Matt @ Google Search
We are not searching the internet, we are searching Google’s index
Spiders fetch a few webpages and fetch those links and get those websites
Google looks for keywords, synonyms, from a quality website, page rank, importance and all this gives our results in seconds
Title, URL, snippets. Links to related and most recent findings.

05 ADA Programming Languages
Compiled: 
converted to BINARY, low level (C, C++, Java)
statically typed programming language does type checking at compile time
Interpreted: 
communicates directly with computer, high level (Ruby, Python, Javascript)
dynamically typed programming does type checking at run time
Ruby (Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto)
Consideration of human interaction
HTML & CSS
Markup language & cascading style sheet language for content on web pages
Html: skeleton
Css: clothes/design
JavaScript
Used alongside HTML and CSS for web programming for dynamic end user experience
Ruby on Rails
Model view controller (MVC) framework that provides database and web pages
ReactJS
Javascript for building user interfaces. 


06 Terminal
Learn the Command Line: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line
Folder Setup Practice: done. Look for “terminal” using command+space


Sample commands: Try out these commands first, and record what happened.


Command	What happened?
ls -a .		lists all the directories
man ls		lists a manual of all the extensions
q		man = asks you what page you want, q quits	
pwd		tells us present directory we’re in
cd ~		goes back to the base directory		
cd .		KateManubatsMBP:~ tinkerbell9064$
cd ..		goes back to the very beginning folder, in this case Jumpstart
cd -		KateManubatsMBP:~ tinkerbell9064$

Make sure to call the directory ADA, then cd Jumpstart, then do follow the exercises. This is where we want to create these folders, under ada/jumpstart!
Touch command updates the files. In the example it went from learning style to learning styleS
$ mkdir songs
$ touch songs/song1.md
$ touch songs/song2.md
$ touch songs/song10.md
$ rm songs/*1*
*needs to cd songs first before copying! 
$ cp song2.md song3.md
$ touch song4.md
$ mv song4.md song1.md
 Using the rm hearts/*.md means that you remove any files inside the file called hearts that have an .md extention
